        <p>How do you identify yourself, by citizenship, culture, color/race, and faith? How can I challenge my thinking and get to know someone who is different from me? Where have I brushed off someone who is not in my social circle at school or in my community?</p>

    <p><strong>Join area high school students on Sunday, February 28th from 4:00-5:30pm for <u>fuZe: An Interfaith and Community Youth Allyship Conference</u>.</strong></p>
    <p>We will foster <strong>understanding and empathy</strong> amongst a diverse Gen Z group. Participants will gain an understanding of how to challenge their own perspectives, the importance of community service, and techniques to <strong>“become comfortable with being uncomfortable”</strong> with the inclusion of new faces in their own social circles. <strong>Together</strong>, we will learn that even with different faiths and cultures, we can be brought together with <strong>shared humanity</strong>. This conference will lay the foundation for relationships based on trust, consistency, and accountability for embracing each other’s differences, creating a <strong>future generation of allies</strong> and a path to <strong>social justice</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>We will meet on February 28 online on Zoom, but we look forward to future events bringing conference participants together in-person, when possible.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Presented by Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center, Welcoming Falls Church, and MOM Network</strong></p>
